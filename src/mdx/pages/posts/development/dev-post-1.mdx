This is a [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) that supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for pages and content. MDX lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents, and makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

The main goal of this starter is to take care of the boilerplate and little things that get in the way of starting a new project, while still being flexible enough to be used as a starting point for a website, blog, or progressive web app.

The addition of MDX makes it possible to embed React components right into your markdown <button>like so</button>, but this remains an optional feature of the starter. Feel free to add new pages the good old Gatsby way, too!
