**Important: Be sure to add all new frontmatter specs to this file and `src/data/MdxContent.ts`.**

This file has all frontmatter fields defined so that their types can be inferred by Gatsby's GraphQL system.
It is marked as partial, so it will not be generated as a page.

In any MDX file except this one:

- All fields except `title` are optional.
- Anything not specified, or set to `none`, is ignored.
- When not specified, slugs are created from titles. They are made lowercase and all non-alphanumerics are converted to dashes.
- `partial` - Set to true to make MDX into a partial. No page will be created by Gatsby. Default `false`.
- `private` - Set to true to make MDX page private. It will not be included in sitemap.xml and its path will be prefixed with the `privatePagePathPrefix` value defined in `src/settings/settings.yml`. Default `false`.
