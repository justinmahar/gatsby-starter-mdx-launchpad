Want to use BoldlyPress for your website, blog, or next big serverless React CMS project?

BoldlyPress was created primarily as a serverless CMS for creating blogs, but with some elbow grease, you can use BoldlyPress to build just about anything. 

If you're already familiar with React, it's easy to get started.

## Initial Setup
---

### Clone BoldlyPress

First, clone the [BoldlyPress project](https://github.com/devboldly/boldlypress) and upload to your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) (or GitLab or BitBucket) account:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:devboldly/boldlypress.git myproject
$ cd myproject
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:devboldly/myproject.git
$ git push -u origin master
```

### Deploy Your Site

Deploy with <a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>:

  1. In <a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, select *New site from Git* and add your project. The project will immediately build and deploy. You can visit the new site when it's done.
  1. Under *Domain settings &raquo; Identity*, enable *Netlify Identity*
  1. Add GitHub to *Identity &raquo; External Providers* (makes it easy to sign into your site)
  1. Enable *Git Gateway* under *Identity &raquo; Services* (used by [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for editing content)
  1. Click your site's link in Netlify, open this Start Here page, and [click this link](/admin) (or add <code>/admin</code> after your site's URL).
  1. [Log into your site](/admin) using your GitHub account.
  1. **Important:** In Netlify, under *Identity &raquo; Registration*, set registration to *Invite Only* after your account is created. Otherwise, anyone can create an account and change your site!

### Configure Your Site

Update site information via the [NetlifyCMS Admin section](/admin) of your new site. 

Most importantly:

  - Change your site name, description, images, and URL in [Site Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/siteMetadataSettings)
  - Configure [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments under [Discussion Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/discussion-settings).
  - Configure your navbar logo/text under [Navbar Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/navbarSettings)
  - Configure social sharing under [Social Sharing Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/socialSharingSettings)
  - Configure [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and [Build Status Badge](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/01/29/sharing-the-love-with-netlify-deployment-badges/) under [Reporting Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/reportingSettings).
    - You can find your Netlify deploy status badge under: *Site settings &raquo; General &raquo; Status badges*

*(Optional)* In your <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite editor</a>, open <code>package.json</code> and update the project name, description, and URLs. Then run <small> `bash:::git add . && git commit -m "Initial setup" && git push` </small>

You're ready to go!

## Start Creating
---

The site comes with a single <Link to="/hello-world">Hello World</Link> blog post and a few default pages, including this one.

Change these however you see fit under the [admin section](/admin) of the site. Be sure to modify the [menus](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/menuSettings) if you change the pages they point to.

### Write Some Code

You can also modify the <code>src/pages/index.tsx</code> homepage, the page templates, or the site's React components if you'd like.

The site is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and heavily uses its conventions, so if you're already familiar with that, you can dive right into the code. To know Gatsby is to know BoldlyPress.

To fully customize BoldlyPress, all you need are a good understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the former two of which have become industry standards.

#### Use The Power of MDX

This site uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for its Markdown. This is a special kind of Markdown that supports JSX components. Just imagine the possibilities!

For instance, I can import and embed a JSX <Button variant="outline-dark" class="mx-1" size="sm" onClick={()=>{alert("Neato!");}}>Button</Button> (or any other component) directly into this document, which is otherwise written in Markdown. Pretty cool, huh? (Take a look at this page's [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devboldly/boldlypress/master/src/pages-mdx/start-here.mdx) to see how to do this.)

This means you can add any React component to any post or page on your site, and it's all editable via the [admin dashboard](/admin)'s UI. I'm sold.

## PrismJS Theme

Code blocks are themed using [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/). There are eight themes available. 

BoldlyPress uses the <small> `Okaidia` </small> theme by default. You can configure the desired theme in <code>gatsby-browser.js</code>. Just comment out all except the one you want.

PrismJS supports inline code syntax highlighting using a prefix. This can be configured in <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.

The default has been set to <small> `:::` </small>. So, for example, in Markdown you would write:

```md
Some JavaScript `js:::console.log("Hello!");`
```

...to highlight inline syntax as: 

<div style="border: solid 1px #CCCCCC; padding: 25px 20px 10px 20px; border-radius: 5px;">

  Some JavaScript `js:::console.log("Hello!");`

</div>

<br/>

## Additional Tools

Below are some additional BoldlyPress features and tools you may find helpful.

### Template Tags

In your site's various settings, you can reference other settings using template tags. 

That way, if you change one setting, all others update automatically. Template tags are [lower camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) keywords that are always wrapped in curly braces. For example, <small> `{siteName}` </small> will reference the site name configured in [Site Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/siteMetadataSettings). Circular references are not allowed.

The following template tags are available:

| Template Tag | Value | Source |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| <small> `{year}` </small> | Current year (i.e. <CoreComponents.CurrentYear/>) | Calendar |
| <small> `{siteName}` </small> | Name of site | [Site Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/siteMetadataSettings) |
| <small> `{siteDescription}` </small> | Description of site | [Site Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/siteMetadataSettings) |
| <small> `{contentTitle}` </small> | Title of current content | [Posts](/admin/#/collections/posts), [Pages](/admin/#/collections/pages) |
| <small> `{contentExcerpt}` </small> | Excerpt from current content | [Posts](/admin/#/collections/posts), [Pages](/admin/#/collections/pages) |
| <small> `{contentCategory}` </small> | Category of current content (or none if not relevant) | [Posts](/admin/#/collections/posts), [Pages](/admin/#/collections/pages) |
| <small> `{contentSeoTitle}` </small> | SEO title of the content | [Posts](/admin/#/collections/posts), [Pages](/admin/#/collections/pages) |
| <small> `{contentSeoDescription}` </small> | SEO description of the content | [Posts](/admin/#/collections/posts), [Pages](/admin/#/collections/pages) |
| <small> `{twitterSiteUsername}` </small> | Twitter username for site | [Social &amp; Sharing Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/socialSharingSettings) |
| <small> `{seoTitleSeparator}` </small> | Separator for use in SEO titles. | [Site SEO Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/seoSettings) |
| <small> `{configSeoTitle}` </small> | SEO title for a particular configuration | [Site SEO Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/seoSettings) |
| <small> `{configSeoDescription}` </small> | SEO description for a particular configuration | [Site SEO Settings](/admin/#/collections/settings/entries/seoSettings) |
