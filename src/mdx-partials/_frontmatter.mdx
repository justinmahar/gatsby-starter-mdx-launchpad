This file has all frontmatter fields defined so that their types can be inferred by Gatsby's GraphQL system. It is marked as partial, so it will not be generated as a page. Add all new frontmatter specs to this file.

- All fields except `title` are optional and fall back on defaults.
- Anything not specified, or set to `none`, is ignored.
- When not specified, slugs are created from titles. They are made lowercase and all non-alphanumerics are converted to dashes.
- `partial` - Set to true to make MDX into a partial. No page will be created by Gatsby. Default `false`.
- `private` - Set to true to make MDX page private. It will not be included in sitemap.xml and its path will be prefixed. Default `false`.
